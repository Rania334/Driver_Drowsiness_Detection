# Driver_Drowsiness_Detection
# Driver Drowsiness Detection System Using CNN and OpenCV

This project implements a real-time driver drowsiness detection system using computer vision and deep learning.

---

## Overview

- Detects open or closed eyes from webcam video feed using Haar cascades and a trained CNN model.
- Raises an alarm sound when driverâ€™s eyes are closed for a continuous period, indicating drowsiness.
- Sends a sleep alert message via MQTT to a remote broker for monitoring.
- Saves a snapshot of the frame when drowsiness is detected.
- Provides visual feedback with bounding boxes and status on the video window.
